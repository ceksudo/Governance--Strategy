# Overview
This stream investigates the technical and sociotechnical foundations for a world of cooperative, pluralistic AI agents. We will tackle fundamental challenges in ensuring agent advocates are confidential, trustworthy, and aligned with their usersâ€™ interests. We seek applicants who can bridge concepts from game theory, economics, and AI to build and analyze these systems.

# Research Project Descriptions
* Projects will focus on enabling a future of pluralistic AI advocate agents. We are open to a range of directions, including:

* Theoretical: Formalizing properties of multi-agent systems, such as user-alignment guarantees or conditions for stable cooperation.

* Technical: Developing methods for agent coordination/negotiation, confidentiality and trust, as well as evaluation frameworks.

* Applied: Building a proof-of-concept system, such as an automated arbitration platform for simple disputes, to demonstrate and test these principles.
